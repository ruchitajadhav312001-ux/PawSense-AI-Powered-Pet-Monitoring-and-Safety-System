Nice, now we lock in the routine so you never have to guess again 💪

I’ll give you **two sets** of commands:

1. 🟣 **ONE-TIME setup** (you probably already did most of this)
2. 🟢 **EVERY TIME you want to run PawSense locally**

I’ll assume your folders are:

```text
~/Desktop/PawSense/pawsense-backend
~/Desktop/PawSense/pawsense-dashboard
```

---

## 🟣 ONE-TIME SETUP (per laptop)

Run these only when you first set things up or clone on a new machine.

### 1) Backend – create venv + install Python deps

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/PawSense/pawsense-backend

# create virtual env (if not already created)
python3 -m venv venv

# activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# install backend libraries
pip install fastapi uvicorn tensorflow pillow numpy twilio python-multipart
```

Ensure your model files exist:

```bash
ls models
```

You should see:

```text
dog_skin_model_finetuned.keras
dog_class_indices.npy
```

---

### 2) Frontend – install node modules

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/PawSense/pawsense-dashboard
npm install
```

That’s it for one-time setup ✅

---

## 🟢 EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO RUN LOCALLY

### 🔹 Step 1: Start backend (Terminal #1)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/PawSense/pawsense-backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Leave this terminal **open**.
You should see:

```text
✅ Model loaded
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

You can quickly check health (optional):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# -> {"status":"ok"}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Start frontend (Terminal #2)

Open a **new terminal window/tab**, then:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/PawSense/pawsense-dashboard
npm run dev
```

It will show something like:

```text
Local: http://localhost:5173
```

Open this in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Make sure URLs in React are local

In `HealthDetection.jsx` (and Dashboard if needed), backend base should be:

```js
const API_BASE = "http://localhost:8000";
const API_URL = `${API_BASE}/dog-skin`;
const SOS_URL = `${API_BASE}/sos-alert`;
```

---

## 🔴 How to STOP everything

* Backend terminal: press `Ctrl + C`
* Frontend terminal: press `Ctrl + C`

Next time you want to run again, just repeat the **EVERY TIME** section:

1. backend commands
2. frontend commands

If you like, I can turn all of this into a small **README.txt** you can keep in the project folder.
